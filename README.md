# Contemporary Issues In Data on contact tracing database application during COVID

In this document, I will be discussing about two articles on contact tracing database application during COVID. I will be talking about two different perspective and their thoughts on this newly launched tracking COVID application.

## Developing a coronavirus contact tracing app
In Quartz's `[The Global tide has turned against centralized contact tracing apps ](https://qz.com/1870907/privacy-issues-push-countries-to-decentralize-contact-tracing-data/), the article talked about the old strategy on tracing COVID which was to collect data on the peoples’ health status and contract history into a central database. Now, this old system is done because United Kingdom developed a coronavirus (COVID) contact tracing application which was developed by Apple and Google. The main idea was to join the application programming interface and use Bluetooth and use an internally log contract. The positive side of this is that no central authority was needed which means that the government does not have to monitor every people. The benefit of this application was that it can track the spread of the virus by GPS location history and history of contact within people. Due to his benefit, the government can also make a better public health decision. 

France was the only country to use a central database because they did not want to give a tech company domination over the country. Nowadays, to make an app, you need big tech companies’ systems because they are in control of the tech market. But when the country controls the data, then there is a disadvantage of publicizing the contract tracing data which can make people uncomfortable.

Overall, the article discusses how the new tracking COVID application benefits people. The benefit is that people are not extensively exposed to the world on their tracing data which is their privacy and the government needs to regain their trust. 

## Survey on contact-tracing app

In the Conversation `[Coronavirus: survey reveals what the public wants from a contact- tracing app ](https://theconversation.com/coronavirus-survey-reveals-what-the-public-wants-from-a-contact-tracing-app-138574), the article discusses that a lot of people need to use the application for this contact tracing application to work and be successful. However, there have been many concerns on this application which were who will be accessing the data and how it will be stored. The major concerns were data privacy where people wanted their data to be anonymized, and also about privacy protection. Trust was the most important issue in this application. People thought that public support was a trust.

In conclusion, people want their data to be protected so when the public trusts authorities, their concern is not high. They think that the law is used in a good way. They want the country to gain more trust from the people. They want the government to be clear on data. From the data, people want the government to let people know that COVID is serious. Even though a lot of people do not trust the government, they want privacy. 

I think that the government needs to be clear on the data because people have the right to know about their data. The government needs to make sure privacy is kept.
